# Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks
This project depicts the code part of my seminar thesis about feature selection in regression tasks, where i dive deeper into the functionality of subset selection and regularization methods. The functionality lies in <a href = "https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks/blob/main/underlying_functions.py" target = "_self">underlying_functions.py</a>, while the illustrations are shown in <a href = "https://github.com/Kai-Ref/Feature-Selection-in-Regression-Tasks/blob/main/Jupyter_Overview.ipynb" target = "_self">Jupyter_Overview.ipynb</a>
